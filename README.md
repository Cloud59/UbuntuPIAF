incrediblefax_ubuntu
====================

This is to install on fresh Ubuntu server 32 bit systems with
incrediblepbx script from nerdvittles.  Modified from original CentOS
version of the incrediblefax script.

Issues:
1.  IAX modems register and show in hylafax but not avantfax interface
2.  Script includes a fix for debian-sys-maint bug inherited from incrediblepbx
3.  MUST RUN AS ROOT not sudo
4.  Need to figure out how to link to web interface
